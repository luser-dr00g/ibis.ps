The wikipedia page mentions some curious history around scribe. Apparently, it was the change in licence and resulting exhorbitant price-hike for the software (from free to very expensive) that was so upsetting to a certain programmer named Richard Stallman that he founded an organization called the Free Software Foundation and began writing its first package, texinfo.
And the rest is history.

Scribe was used to produce the first edition PostScript Language Reference Manual.

The program implements a markup language and then presents a manual in that markup.
