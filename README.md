a document formatting engine inspired by scribe
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe_(markup_language)

Project resumed from broken draft posted to usenet in 2011

The wikipedia page mentions some curious history around scribe. Apparently, it was the change in licence and resulting exhorbitant price-hike for the software (from free to very expensive) that was so upsetting to a certain programmer named Richard Stallman that he founded an organization called the Free Software Foundation and began writing its first package, texinfo.
And the rest is history.

Scribe was use to produce the first edition PostScript Language Reference Manual.
